"dm","runningman_1on1remix",1,1,10,,"DM: Running Man (1on1)","Welcome to the Nexuiz Campaign!\n\nFirst of all, you're going to learn the controls of the game by playing an easy 1on1 deathmatch against a single unskilled bot.\n\nFirst one to kill the other 10 times wins."
"dm","darkzone",2,2,15,,"DM: Q1DM6 Remake","On this remake of a beloved level from the original Quake(r) from id Software, you'll face two bots on a somewhat higher skill level.\n\n15 frags will make you a winner here."

"dm","soylent",1,4,20,,"DM: Soylent Space","This time, you will face a single bot on an interesting space arena that allows many movement tricks. Try to learn these tricks so you can find your enemy faster.\n\nYou win once you have 20 frags."
"dm","skyway",3,5,15,"g_minstagib 1","SPECIAL: Skyway","MinstaGib means that everyone is equipped with a single weapon that both kills with one shot, and can be used for jumping like the Laser can.\n\nLearn using it to fight off the three enemies that somehow have arrived here too!\n\nThe frag limit is 15."
